## RT_test.py
### Code Review for `RT_test.py`

#### Strengths:
1. **Modular Design**: The code is structured with functions (`clear_console`, `text_detected`, `process_text`) that encapsulate specific functionalities, making it easier to read and maintain.
2. **Use of Libraries**: The integration of `colorama` for colored console output enhances user experience, providing visual feedback.
3. **Global Variables**: The use of global variables (`displayed_text`, `last_text`) is minimal and well-contained within the functions, which helps in tracking state without excessive complexity.
4. **Error Handling**: The `try-except` block in `text_detected` function ensures that any exceptions are caught and logged, preventing crashes during runtime.

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Global Variables**: While the use of global variables is limited, it can still lead to potential issues in larger applications. Consider refactoring to use class attributes or a more structured approach to manage state.
2. **Hardcoded Values**: The recorder configuration contains several hardcoded values (e.g., `sensitivity`, `language`). It would be beneficial to externalize these configurations to a settings file or allow user input for flexibility.
3. **Console Clearing**: The `clear_console` function uses `os.system` to clear the console, which may not work consistently across all environments (e.g., IDEs or certain terminal emulators). Consider using a more portable approach or providing a toggle for this feature.
4. **Infinite Loop**: The `while True` loop runs indefinitely without a clear exit strategy. It would be prudent to implement a way to gracefully exit the loop, such as listening for a specific input or signal.
5. **Uninitialized Callback**: The `on_realtime_transcription_update` in `recorder_config` is set to `None`, which may lead to unexpected behavior. It should be assigned to `text_detected` to ensure it functions as intended.

#### Suggestions:
1. **Refactor Global Variables**: Consider encapsulating the functionality within a class to manage state more effectively and reduce reliance on global variables.
2. **Configuration Management**: Move the recorder configuration to a separate configuration file or allow it to be passed as command-line arguments for better flexibility and maintainability.
3. **Graceful Exit**: Implement a mechanism to break out of the infinite loop, such as listening for a specific keyboard input (e.g., `Ctrl+C` or a specific command).
4. **Improve Console Clearing**: Consider using a library like `curses` for better cross-platform console manipulation or simply avoid clearing the console and instead use line updates for a smoother user experience.
5. **Logging**: Instead of printing exceptions directly, consider using the `logging` module for better control over logging levels and outputs.

By addressing these points, the code can be made more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly.
