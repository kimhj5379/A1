## RT_test.py
### Code Review for `RT_test.py`

#### Strengths:
1. **Modular Design**: The code is organized into functions (`clear_console`, `text_detected`, `process_text`), which enhances readability and maintainability.
2. **Use of Libraries**: The integration of `colorama` for colored console output improves user experience by making the output visually distinct.
3. **Global Variable Management**: The use of global variables (`displayed_text`, `last_text`) is minimal and controlled, which helps in tracking state without excessive complexity.
4. **Error Handling**: The `try-except` block in `text_detected` provides a basic level of error handling, ensuring that exceptions are caught and logged.

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Global Variables**: The use of global variables can lead to unintended side effects, especially in larger applications. It may be beneficial to encapsulate state within a class or pass state as parameters.
2. **Console Clearing**: The `clear_console` function uses system calls to clear the console, which may not work consistently across all environments (e.g., some IDEs and Windows terminals).
3. **Infinite Loop**: The `while True` loop runs indefinitely without a clear exit strategy. This could lead to issues if the program needs to be terminated gracefully.
4. **Hardcoded Configuration**: The recorder configuration is hardcoded. It may be beneficial to externalize this configuration to a separate file or allow user input for flexibility.
5. **Comment Language**: There is a comment in Korean ("콘솔 클리어하고 마지막 문장만 출력") which may not be understandable to all developers. Consistent use of English comments is recommended for broader accessibility.

#### Suggestions:
1. **Refactor Global Variables**: Consider refactoring the code to use a class to encapsulate the state and behavior, reducing reliance on global variables.
   
   ```python
   class RealTimeSTT:
       def __init__(self):
           self.displayed_text = ""
           self.last_text = ""
           # Initialize other attributes

       def clear_console(self):
           # Implementation

       def text_detected(self, text):
           # Implementation

       def process_text(self, text):
           # Implementation
   ```

2. **Implement Exit Strategy**: Introduce a mechanism to break out of the infinite loop, such as listening for a specific key press or a signal.
   
   ```python
   import signal
   import sys

   def signal_handler(sig, frame):
       print("\nExiting...")
       sys.exit(0)

   signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)
   ```

3. **Improve Console Clearing**: Consider using a cross-platform library like `curses` or handle console clearing in a way that is more compatible with various environments.
4. **Externalize Configuration**: Move the recorder configuration to a JSON or YAML file to allow for easier modifications without changing the code.
5. **Consistent Commenting**: Ensure all comments are in English to maintain consistency and improve code readability for a wider audience.

By addressing these points, the code can be made more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly.
